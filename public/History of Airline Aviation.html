            <li><h2>Early Beginnings (1903-1914)</h2></li>

            <p>The Wright brothers made history in 1903 with the first powered flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.o	Although this was a significant milestone, it would take another decade before the concept of using airplanes for commercial purposes began to take hold.</p>
            <li><h2>The First Commercial Flights (1914-1920s)</h2></li>

            <p>The world’s first scheduled passenger airline service began in 1914 in Florida, with the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line flying a single passenger across Tampa Bay. During World War I (1914-1918), airplanes were mainly used for military purposes, but advancements in aircraft technology laid the groundwork for post-war commercial aviation.</p>
            <li><h2>The Rise of Commercial Aviation (1920s-1930s)</h2></li>

            <p>After the war, many military pilots transitioned into civilian roles, fueling the growth of airlines. In 1919, the first international flight route was established between London and Paris by British airline company Air Transport & Travel. The 1920s saw the formation of major airlines like KLM (1919), Qantas (1920), and Lufthansa (1926), marking the beginning of regular passenger services. The 1930s saw the rise of aircraft such as the Boeing 247 and Douglas DC-3, which revolutionized air travel with improved speed, safety, and capacity.</p>
            <li><h2>World War II and Its Impact on Aviation (1939-1945)</h2></li>

            <p>The aviation industry underwent rapid technological advancements during World War II, particularly in aircraft design, engines, and navigation. Post-war, many of these advancements were adapted for commercial use, leading to larger and faster aircraft.</p>
            <li><h2>The Jet Age (1950s-1970s)</h2></li>
            <img src="../assets/images/the Jet Age (1950s-1970s).jpg" width="400"/>
            <p>In 1952, the British de Havilland Comet became the world’s first commercial jetliner, marking the beginning of the Jet Age. The 1960s saw the introduction of wide-body jets like the Boeing 747, which allowed airlines to carry more passengers over longer distances, significantly lowering the cost of air travel. During this period, air travel became increasingly accessible to the general public, and international travel soared.</p>
            <li><h2>Deregulation and the Rise of Budget Airlines (1970s-1990s)</h2></li>
            <img src="../assets/images/Deregulation and the Rise of Budget Airlines (1970s.jpg" width="400"/>
            <p>In 1978, the U.S. Airline Deregulation Act was passed, which eliminated government control over fares, routes, and market entry. This led to increased competition, the rise of low-cost carriers (LCCs), and lower ticket prices. Ryanair and Southwest Airlines became pioneers of the budget airline model, focusing on affordable, no-frills services.</p>
            <li><h2>Technological Advancements and Modernization</h2></li>
            <img src="../assets/images/Technological Advancements and Modernization .jpg" width="400"/>
            <p>The 1990s and early 2000s saw significant advancements in avionics, fuel efficiency, and aircraft safety. The rise of digital technology brought improvements in flight navigation, booking systems, and customer service through online platforms. Airbus launched the A380 in 2005, the world’s largest commercial airliner, while Boeing introduced the fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliner in 2011.Recent trends focus on sustainability, with airlines exploring biofuels, electric aircraft, and more efficient jet engines to reduce their environmental impact.</p>
            <li><h2>The Future of Aviation</h2></li>
            <img src="../assets/images/The Future of Aviation.jpg" width="400"/>
            <p>The airline industry continues to evolve, with a focus on sustainability, automation, and reducing the environmental footprint. Innovations like autonomous aircraft, supersonic jets, and next-generation propulsion technologies are poised to shape the future of commercial air travel.</p>
