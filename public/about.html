        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I am Muhammad Naveed, a full stack web developer who loves building dynamic and responsive websites. My focus is on creating user-friendly applications that look great and work smoothly. I have spent years working with various web technologies, and I enjoy tackling both the front-end design and back-end development to make sure everything works together seamlessly.</p>
        <p>I am well-versed in tools like Flexbox and Grid, which I use to create layouts that look awesome on any device. On the back-end side, I work with SQL databases, specifically PostgreSQL. We recently switched from MongoDB to Postgres after realizing that more companies are looking for SQL-based solutions nowadays. It’s all about keeping up with what businesses need!</p>
        <p>What drives me is building applications that not only get the job done but also provide an amazing experience for users. Whether it’s creating smooth interfaces or building a strong back-end, I’m all about delivering quality solutions that work.</p>

        <h2>What I Can Do for You</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Front-End Development</h3></li>
            <p>I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular to create intuitive, responsive interfaces. With my expertise in Flexbox and Grid, I can design complex layouts that look good on any screen, from mobile to desktop.</p>
            <li><h3>Back-End Development</h3></li>
            <p>I build secure, efficient server-side applications using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. After some thorough research, I moved from MongoDB to PostgreSQL since many businesses now prefer SQL-based systems.</p>
            <li><h3>Database Management</h3></li>
            <p>I specialize in PostgreSQL, providing services like database design, implementation, and optimization. My focus on SQL databases helps companies maintain reliable data systems that can grow with their needs.</p>
            <li><h3>API Integration</h3></li>
            <p>Need different systems to work together? I can help by building and integrating RESTful APIs, ensuring your software communicates smoothly and your data flows seamlessly.</p>
            <li><h3>Responsive Web Design</h3></li>
            <p>I make sure your website looks great on every device, whether it’s a phone, tablet, or desktop, using modern tools like Flexbox and Grid to create fluid, responsive layouts.</p>
